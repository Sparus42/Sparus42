# Hi, I'm Kevin!

I research AI, focusing on deep reinforcement learning in combination with other ML methods. People who say RL isn't useful are my sworn enemies. ⚔️

My favorite thing in life is learning and teaching others what I've learned, whether that be gaming, art, or programming. Probably explains why I like training computers so much, too.
